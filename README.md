### React meals
My first mini-project written in React 18.

## Practices/patterns used in this project
- Hooks (useState, useContext, useEffect, useReducer)
- Portals (porting Modal inside an "overlays" div on top of the DOM)
- ForwardRef (to be able to pass any ref to custom components)
- CSS modules
